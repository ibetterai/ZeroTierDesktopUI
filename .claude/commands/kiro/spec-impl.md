# Execute Spec Tasks with Enhanced TDD & Knife Surgery

Execute implementation tasks for **$1** using enhanced TDD methodology with context understanding and error documentation.

## Phase 1: Pre-Execution & Context Understanding

### 1.1 Validation & Context Loading
Validate required files exist for feature **$1**:
- Requirements: `.kiro/specs/$1/requirements.md`
- Design: `.kiro/specs/$1/design.md`  
- Tasks: `.kiro/specs/$1/tasks.md`
- Metadata: `.kiro/specs/$1/spec.json`

**Core Steering:**
- Structure: @.kiro/steering/structure.md
- Tech Stack: @.kiro/steering/tech.md  
- Product: @.kiro/steering/product.md

**Custom Steering:**
- Additional `*.md` files in `.kiro/steering/` (excluding structure.md, tech.md, product.md)

**Knowledge Base:**
- Review all relevant research documents in `.kiro/knowledge/`
- Check for existing error solutions in `.kiro/knowledge/errors/`

### 1.2 Knife Surgery Preparation (MANDATORY - CANNOT BE SKIPPED)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: THIS STEP CANNOT BE BYPASSED ⚠️**

**YOU MUST READ TARGET FILES BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES - NO EXCEPTIONS**

Before making ANY code changes, you MUST understand the existing codebase by completing ALL of these steps:

1. **MANDATORY Target File Reading**:
   - **EXECUTE NOW**: Use Read tool to read ALL target files that will be modified
   - **REQUIRED**: Understand existing code structure, patterns, dependencies  
   - **REQUIRED**: Identify integration points and potential impact areas
   - **REQUIRED**: Map existing functions, classes, and interfaces
   - **CANNOT PROCEED**: Until you have read and analyzed target files

2. **MANDATORY Context Understanding**:
   - **EXECUTE NOW**: Analyze file dependencies and imports using Read/Grep tools
   - **REQUIRED**: Understand data flow and business logic
   - **REQUIRED**: Identify existing error handling patterns
   - **REQUIRED**: Note coding style and conventions
   - **VALIDATION**: Confirm you understand the existing code before proceeding

3. **MANDATORY Impact Assessment**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Determine minimal change approach based on actual code analysis
   - **REQUIRED**: Identify EXACTLY which functions/classes need modification
   - **REQUIRED**: Plan surgical changes to avoid breaking functionality
   - **REQUIRED**: Consider backward compatibility with existing integrations

**CHECKPOINT**: You cannot proceed to TDD implementation until you have completed file reading and analysis.

## Phase 2: Enhanced TDD Implementation

### 2.1 Task Execution Process
1. **Feature**: $1  
2. **Task numbers**: $2 (optional, defaults to all pending tasks)
3. **For each selected task**, follow enhanced TDD:

### 2.2 Enhanced TDD Cycle with Error Handling

**Step 1: UNDERSTAND (MANDATORY - NO BYPASSING)**
- **EXECUTE NOW**: Use Read tool to read and analyze ALL target files thoroughly
- **VALIDATE**: Confirm you understand existing patterns and architecture  
- **PLAN**: Document minimal, surgical changes based on actual code analysis
- **CHECKPOINT**: Cannot proceed until target files are read and understood

**Step 2: RED - Write Failing Tests**
- Write failing tests first
- **Error Handling**: If encountering test framework errors:
  - Use WebSearch to find solutions (search GitHub, Stack Overflow, Reddit)
  - Document in `.kiro/knowledge/errors/{errorname}.md`
  - Include search queries used and sources found

**Step 3: GREEN - Implement with Knife Surgery**
- Write minimal code to pass tests
- **Make surgical changes only** - modify specific lines/functions
- Preserve existing functionality and patterns
- **Error Handling**: If encountering implementation errors:
  - NO ASSUMPTIONS - use WebSearch immediately
  - Search for exact error messages and solutions
  - Document error and solution in `.kiro/knowledge/errors/{errorname}.md`

**Step 4: REFACTOR - Clean Up Surgically**
- Refactor with minimal impact
- Maintain existing code style and patterns
- **Error Handling**: If refactoring causes issues:
  - Use WebSearch for best practices
  - Document approach in knowledge base

**Step 5: SELF-REVIEW & MISTAKE CHECK (MANDATORY - CANNOT BE SKIPPED)**

**⚠️ YOU MUST PERFORM THIS STEP - NO EXCEPTIONS ⚠️**

- **EXECUTE NOW**: Use Read tool to re-read ALL modified files completely
- **MANDATORY Systematic Review**: Check for these mistake categories:
  - ✅ Syntax errors and typos
  - ✅ Logic errors and edge cases  
  - ✅ Integration issues with existing code
  - ✅ Missing imports or dependencies
  - ✅ Inconsistent naming or patterns
  - ✅ Performance issues
- **REQUIRED**: If ANY mistakes found, document in `.kiro/knowledge/errors/mistake-{description}-{number}.md`
- **MANDATORY Self-Correction Loop**: If mistakes detected:
  1. **MUST DO**: Document the mistake with context
  2. **MUST DO**: Fix the mistake using surgical changes  
  3. **MUST DO**: Use Read tool to re-read modified files again
  4. **MUST DO**: Repeat until no obvious mistakes remain

**VALIDATION CHECKPOINT**: Confirm ALL modified files have been re-read and checked for mistakes before proceeding to verification.

**Step 6: VERIFY & DOCUMENT**
- All tests pass
- No regressions in existing functionality  
- Code quality maintained
- **If errors occurred**: Update error documentation with working solutions
- **Self-review completed**: Confirm all mistake checks passed

### 2.3 Mistake Detection & Self-Review (NEW)

**CRITICAL**: After each code modification, perform systematic mistake detection:

#### Mistake Categories to Check
1. **Syntax & Structure**:
   - Missing semicolons, brackets, parentheses
   - Indentation and formatting issues
   - Typos in variable/function names

2. **Logic & Integration**:
   - Incorrect function calls or parameters
   - Missing error handling
   - Integration issues with existing code
   - Edge cases not handled

3. **Dependencies & Imports**:
   - Missing import statements
   - Unused imports
   - Incorrect module paths
   - Version compatibility issues

4. **Performance & Best Practices**:
   - Inefficient algorithms or patterns
   - Memory leaks potential
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Code style inconsistencies

#### Self-Review Process
```markdown
1. Re-read ALL modified files completely
2. Check each category systematically
3. Document any mistakes found
4. Apply surgical fixes immediately
5. Re-read files after fixes
6. Repeat until clean
```

### 2.4 Mistake Documentation Format (NEW)
When detecting ANY mistake during self-review, create `.kiro/knowledge/errors/mistake-{description}-{number}.md`:

```markdown

```

## Phase 3: Completion & Knowledge Management

### 3.1 Task Completion
- **Mark Complete**: Update checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in tasks.md
- **Document Changes**: Brief summary of surgical changes made
- **Update Knowledge**: Add any new patterns or insights to knowledge base

### 3.2 Knowledge Base Maintenance
- **Error Solutions**: Ensure all errors are documented with solutions
- **Patterns**: Document any new coding patterns discovered
- **Research**: File any additional research findings

## Enhanced Implementation Rules

1. **NEVER assume** - always use WebSearch for unknown errors
2. **ALWAYS read target files** before making changes
3. **Make surgical changes only** - preserve existing functionality
4. **MANDATORY self-review** - re-read ALL modified files for mistakes
5. **Self-correction loop** - fix mistakes immediately when detected
6. **Document ALL errors & mistakes** with research and solutions
7. **Verify backwards compatibility** after changes
8. **Update knowledge base** with findings

**Note**: This enhanced methodology with self-review ensures code changes are minimal, mistake-free, well-researched, and thoroughly documented for future reference.

## Implementation Notes

- **Feature**: Use `$1` for feature name
- **Tasks**: Use `$2` for specific task numbers (optional)
- **Validation**: Check all required spec files exist
- **TDD Focus**: Always write tests before implementation
- **Task Tracking**: Update checkboxes in tasks.md as completed
